October 2023

This repository contains the activitites done and certificates achieved to obtain the Google Advanced Data Analystics Certificate via Coursera. This program had 7 courses included in it to complete. Each course has its own completion certificate as well as a python activity and a report. These python activities focused on using python, data exploration skills, and data visualization skills to determine factors that affect the churn rate for Waze users. The program also contained a final capstone project in which I had to determine the greatest factors that improve employee retention for a fictional company.
